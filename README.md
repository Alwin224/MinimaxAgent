# MinimaxAgent
This project uses a Minimax Agent and Minimax AlphaBeta Pruning Agent to play against you in Connect Four.
This application was made using a GUI framework in Eclipse. The agent plays against the user and there is 
a document that rates both of them against each other to see if the Minimax AlphaBeta Pruning Agent is better 
than the Minimax Agent
